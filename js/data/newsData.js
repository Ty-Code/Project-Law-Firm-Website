    'Constitutional Court’s Significant Decision on Monitoring Employee’s Whatsapp Conversations',
    text: `<p>The Turkish Constitutional Court (&ldquo;the Court&rdquo;), in its decision no: 2018/34548 and dated 28.12.2021, ruled that an employee&rsquo;s right to respect for private life and freedom of communication were violated due to the employer&rsquo;s obtaining of the correspondence of the applicant using the messaging application called WhatsApp and the termination of the employment contract on the basis of these correspondences. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 11 February 2022 and is available online in Turkish <u><a href="https://kararlarbilgibankasi.anayasa.gov.tr/BB/2018/34548">here</a></u>.</p>
    <p><strong>Background&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>The applicant, an employee of a private company, works in a public hospital. The applicant&rsquo;s employment contract was terminated after one of the directors of the hospital saw WhatsApp messages of the applicant on the computer allocated to the applicant. As a result of the lawsuit filed by the applicant with a reinstatement action, the first instance court ruled that the termination was invalid and ordered reinstatement of the applicant. In the appeal filed by the employer against the aforementioned decision, the regional court of appeals reversed the first decision and rejected the case.</p>
    <p>The applicant filed an application to the Court alleging that the right to respect for private life and the freedom of communication were violated, due to the employer&rsquo;s examination of the correspondence he sent via WhatsApp and the termination of his employment contract on the basis of these correspondences.</p>
    <p><strong>Constitutional Court&rsquo;s Decision</strong></p>
    <p>According to the Court, although the employer&rsquo;s control of the communication tools and gadgets made available to the employee is not specifically regulated in the Labor Law No. 4857, there is no obstacle to the implementation of the guarantees regarding the right to respect for private life and freedom of communication in Articles 20 and 22 of the Constitution in labor law disputes.</p>
    <p>Regarding whether the interference by the employer is in accordance with the general principles, the Courts emphasises that the following facts should be taken into account:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>How the restrictive regulations are determined in the employment contracts according to the conditions of the concrete case,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whether the employees are informed about these regulations,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whether the legitimate aim that causes the interference with the fundamental rights of the employees is proportional to the intervention,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whether the termination of the contract is a reasonable and proportionate action against the actions or inactions of the employees.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Court states that the employer&rsquo;s authority to control the employee&rsquo;s communication should be examined within the scope of the positive obligations of the state in the context of the right to respect for private life and freedom of communication and that a balance should be found between the employer&rsquo;s interests and the employee&rsquo;s fundamental rights and freedoms in disputes arising from the employer&rsquo;s use of communication tools and equipment such as computers, the internet, and e-mail.</p>
    <p>It is crucial to remember that the management authority of the employer is limited to the execution of the work in the workplace and the provision of the order and security of the workplace. In this context, considering that the communication tools made available at the workplace belong to the employer, accepting that the employer has an unlimited and absolute monitoring and control authority over the communication tools will not be compatible with the employee&rsquo;s reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the evaluation by the Court, instead of accessing the content of the employee&rsquo;s communication, it should be checked whether it is possible to implement less intrusive methods and measures. In order for the intervention by the employer to be considered necessary, it should not be possible to achieve the same goal with a milder intervention.</p>
    <p>The interference will be deemed to be proportionate, if the data to be processed or used in any way through the control of the communication is limited to the intended purpose. Considering the impact of the monitoring on the employee and the consequences for the employee, it is necessary to look at whether the conflicting interests and rights of the parties are balanced fairly.</p>
    <p>Another highly important point that should not be forgotten is that the employees should be fully and clearly notified beforehand about the monitoring of the communication made over the computer allocated for use in the workplace and the conditions of use of the communication tools. According to the Court&rsquo;s evaluation, the notification should cover the followings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The legal basis and purposes of the processing of personal data,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The scope of the monitoring and data processing,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The period of storage of the data,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The rights of the data subject,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The results of the monitoring and processing,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The possible beneficiaries of the data, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The limitations stipulated by the employer regarding the use of communication tools.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In cases where such full and clear notification is not provided, it should be deemed as foreseeable by the employer that the employee can make personal correspondence through the workplace with the reasonable expectation that his fundamental rights and freedoms will also be protected at the workplace.</p>
    <p>However, in the concrete case, it was not discussed by the courts of instance whether a clear notification as such was made or not. Also, the applicant claims that the contents of the messages were accessed unlawfully without his consent although they were not made public and without prior notification.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Court claimed that the employer could not give a clear explanation that he had legally obtained the private messages on the applicant&apos;s computer and did not explain that there had been a situation that required access to the content of the communication on the applicant&apos;s computer.</p>
    <p>As a result of all these evaluations, the Constitutional Court decided that the applicant&rsquo;s right to respect for private life and freedom of communication were violated.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>Personal data processing activities, such as monitoring employees and their communications, may have consequences against employers within the scope of both labor law, personal data protection law and moreover human rights law comprising all of these. In this respect, it can be said that the processes should be carried out more sensitively and transparently when it comes to processing personal data of employees.</p>
    <p>To sum up, it would be fair to come up with the conclusion that the following elements are very important in employee monitoring activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Whether the employee to be monitored or audited is informed,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The legitimate aim to be achieved by monitoring,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The proportionality of the monitoring and its limitation to the purpose,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whether it is possible to implement less intrusive methods and measures.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The data to be obtained is limited to the intended purpose.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    title: 'Amendments to the Advertising Legislation in Turkey and Europe',
    text: `<p>On February, 1<sup>st</sup> 2022 The Regulation Amending the Commercial Advertising and Unfair Commercial Practices Regulation was published on Official Gazette. The amendments include essential changes on advertising activities including consumers&rsquo; purchasing behavior data, discounted sales and unfair commercial practices.</p>
    <p>The amending regulation introduces a new term defined as &ldquo;personalized price&rdquo;. A personalized price is the price offered by analyzing the purchasing behavior and other personal data of the consumer for a good or service. In the event that a price is offered to the consumer in this way, the information regarding this matter, the current sales price and personalized price determined by the seller or supplier for that good or service shall be included in the same advertisement.</p>
    <p>Following the amendment made on discounted sales, in the determination of the sales price of a good or service before the discount, the lowest price applied within thirty days before the discount shall be taken as the basis. However, when calculating the amount or rate of the discount in advertisements for perishable goods such as fruit and vegetables, the price before the discounted price is taken as a basis. Starting from the March, 1<sup>st</sup> 2022, it will be mandatory to include the price before the discount on the advertisements about the discounted sales.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With the amendment made on the advertisements about the financial services, the maturity of the credit, the interest rate, the monthly and annual percentage value of the total cost to the consumer, and the repayment conditions will be shown through a website or pop-up screen where consumers can be directed to get detailed information with a link or warning sign placed in the area where the advertisement is published.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The amendment features various new articles, one of them being Article 28/A regulating rankings. In accordance with the article, in case of ranking by comparing the price, quality and similar aspects of a good or service offered for sale on the internet, the information on which criteria the ranking was created is placed in the same field or in a way that can be easily seen on the pop-up screen where consumers can be directed and get detailed information with a link or warning sign.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With the additional paragraph, added to the section titled &ldquo;A-Deceptive Commercial Practices&rdquo; in the annex of the Commercial Advertising and Unfair Commercial Practices Regulation, using methods such as guiding interface designs, options or expressions related to a good or service on the internet, which negatively affect the will of consumers to make a decision or choice, or which aim to cause changes in favour of the seller or provider in the decision they will make under normal conditions are considered as a deceptive commercial practice.</p>
    <p>The mentioned amendments entered into force on March, 1<sup>st</sup> 2022. The new amendments will be implemented together with the guidelines that will be published by the Advertisement Board on the Ministry of Trade&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The legislation shows us that with the growth of e-commerce industry and improving use of data on advertising, digital markets and electronic communications the lawmakers tend to draw attention to certain points that organizations should comply with.</p>
    <p>The Commercial Advertising and Unfair Commercial Practices Regulation shows great similarities with the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive(&ldquo;UCPD&rdquo;), which is amended by the Directive (EU) 2019/2161. The amendments will enter into force on May, 28<sup>th</sup> 2022. The Directive is horizontal in nature and protects the economic interests of consumers. Its principle-based provisions address a wide range of practices and are sufficiently broad to catch also fast-evolving products and sales methods.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>According to the UCPD, a commercial practice is any act, omission, course of conduct or representation, commercial communication including advertising and marketing, by a trader, directly connected with the promotion, sale or supply of a product to consumers. In the said Directive, there are many definitions like this one, which are also included in the Commercial Advertising and Unfair Commercial Practices Regulation.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market and achieve a high level of consumer protection by approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on unfair commercial practices harming consumers&rsquo; economic interests.</p>
    <p>The UCPD complements various European regulations, one of them being The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (&ldquo;Directive 2010/13/EU&rdquo;) which applies to linear and nonlinear audiovisual media services (i.e. TV broadcasting and on-demand media services), which can include audiovisual commercial communications which directly or indirectly promote goods or services. Directive 2010/13/EU lays down general information requirements for service providers, while also laying down the requirements with which all audiovisual commercial communications must comply.</p>
    <p>Same with the Turkish legislation, commercial practices that may affect the consumer&rsquo;s purchasing decision and behaviour are prohibited in the European legislation. As a matter of fact, the definition of &ldquo;to materially distort the economic behaviour of consumers&rdquo; is included in the UCPD, that is using a commercial practice to appreciably impair the consumer&rsquo;s ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing the consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the UCPD, a commercial practice shall be regarded as misleading if it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct, in relation to one or more of the following elements, and in either case causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The existence or nature of the product,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The main characteristics of the product, such as its availability, benefits, risks, execution, composition, accessories, after-sale customer assistance and complaint handling, method and date of manufacture or provision, delivery, fitness for purpose, usage, quantity, specification, geographical or commercial origin or the results to be expected from its use, or the results and material features of tests or checks carried out on the product,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The extent of the trader&rsquo;s commitments, the motives for the commercial practice and the nature of the sales process, any statement or symbol in relation to direct or indirect sponsorship or approval of the trader or the product,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The price or the manner in which the price is calculated, or the existence of a specific price advantage,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The need for a service, part, replacement or repair,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The nature, attributes and rights of the trader or his agent, such as his identity and assets, his qualifications, status, approval, affiliation or connection and ownership of industrial, commercial or intellectual property rights or his awards and distinctions.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As can be seen, Article 7 of the Commercial Advertising and Unfair Commercial Practices Regulation is directly proportional with the Article 6 of the UCPD and &ldquo;average consumer&rdquo; has been included in both Turkish and European legislation. Evidently, it would not be wrong to say that there are great similarities between UCPD and the Commercial Advertising and Unfair Commercial Practices Regulation in terms of the prohibitions and obligations they contain.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this respect, complying with one of them means to a large extent to comply with the other one. This is of great importance for advertisers in order to avoid various administrative sanctions regulated in the legislation.</p>`,

    title: 'A Building Block of the European Data Strategy: The Data Act',
    text: `<p>On February, 23<sup>rd</sup> 2022, the European Commission (&ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;) has published a new and long awaited proposal for the Data Act (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;). It is evaluated by the Commission that the Act will &ldquo;ensure fairness in the digital environment, stimulate a competitive data market, open opportunities for data-driven innovation and make data more accessible for all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Therefore, The Act is considered to be one of the pioneers of the European Data Strategy and aims to provide fair access to data and to regulate the procedures and principles regarding the use of data. The Data Act is the second main regulation after the recently adopted Data Governance Act (&ldquo;the DGA&rdquo;) which were both foreseen on the February 2020 European strategy for data and it complements the DGA.</p>
    <p>Although it is prepared in accordance and consistent with the General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;), the Act provides a broad definition of data, covering all kinds of digital outlooks of both personal and non-personal data, unlike GDPR. The Data Act applies to;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Manufacturers of products and suppliers of related services placed on the market in the EU and the users of such products or services,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Data holders that make data available to data recipients in the EU,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Data recipients in the EU to whom data are made available,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Public sector bodies and EU institutions, agencies or bodies that request data holders to make data available where there is an exceptional need to that data for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and the data holders that provide those data in response to such request,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Providers of data processing services offering such services to customers in the EU.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are certain obligations envisaged to data owners, such as making available to the user the data generated by its use of a product or related service where data cannot be directly accessed by the user from the product and without undue delay, free of charge and if possible, continuously and in real-time. Within the scope of the Data Act, regulations regarding the protection of trade secret and intellectual property rights in data transfers are also included in the proposal.</p>
    <p>The Data Act gives public bodies a limited and exceptional right to access data held by the private sector. This right can be used where the access is necessary to prevent, respond to or recover from a public emergency such as terrorist attacks, public health emergencies, natural disasters, or where the lack of data prevents the public body from fulfilling a duty in the public interest provided by law.</p>
    <p>The small and medium enterprises (&ldquo;SMEs&rdquo;) will have a protective shield against unfair contractual terms, which gives them a higher chance on negotiating. According to the Commission, clauses that do not pass the &ldquo;unfairness test&rdquo; will not be binding on SMEs. There will be standard and non-binding contractual terms developed and recommended by the Commission that will provide a fairer negotiation process for SMEs.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As the European Commission mentioned, the legislative initiatives including the Data Act will create a single market to allow data to flow freely within the EU and across sectors for the benefit of businesses, researchers, public administrations and society at large and the Data Act is deemed to be one of the main initiatives. It is believed that the new regulation will result in stimulation of data economy.</p>`,
