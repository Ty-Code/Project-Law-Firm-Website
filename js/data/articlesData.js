    title: 'European Data Strategy: What Organizations Need to Know?',
    text: `<p>Organizations have an incredible amount of data about customers, suppliers and preventing data flow does not seem possible in today&rsquo;s conditions. For this reason, it is necessary to determine the processes, procedures, policies, roles and standards within the organization that ensure the effective use of data in order for an organization to achieve its aims. This can only be achieved through data governance policy. Data governance ensures that data-related roles are clearly defined and that responsibility and accountability are agreed upon across the organization. In this regard, organizations should consider regulations on data governance that are currently in effect or are under preparation. Besides General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;), European Union data framework provides a source of inspiration to organizations adopting legal measures in certain areas.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of those regulations is Data Governance Act(&ldquo;DGA&rdquo;), presented to European Commission for the first time in 2020. The Data Governance Act realizes that data obtained from public sector bodies can be reused for commercial purposes or even be provided for a reasonable and proportionate price. With that awareness, the DGA will create a mechanism to enable the safe reuse of certain categories of public-sector data that are subject to the rights of others. It applies to data held by public sector bodies which are protected on the grounds of commercial confidentiality, statistical confidentiality, protection of intellectual property rights of third parties, protection of personal data.</p>
    <p>The DGA provides certain obligations, especially in terms of data subjects, for data sharing service providers who will act as intermediaries between the data holders and the data users. For this purpose, public bodies will be expected to protect the rights and interests of third parties &mdash; for instance, by taking technical measures or by helping re-users seek the appropriate legal basis such as obtaining explicit consent from the data subjects.</p>
    <p>Another legal regulation which has been proposed but not entered into force yet is Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications, known as ePrivacy Regulation. The ePrivacy Regulation is in cooperation with the GDPR in terms of its privacy provisions. It clearly stipulates that any interference with electronic communications data, such as by listening, tapping, storing, monitoring, scanning or other kinds of interception, surveillance or processing of electronic communications data, by persons other than the end-users, shall be prohibited, except when permitted by the Regulation.</p>
    <p>The ePrivacy Regulation lays down rules regarding the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural and legal persons in the provision and use of electronic communications services, and in particular, the rights to respect for private life and communications and the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The territorial scope of the ePrivacy Regulation has been proposed to be the provision of electronic communications services to end-users in the EU, irrespective of whether a payment of the end-user is required, the use of such of such services and the protection of information related to the terminal equipment of end-users located in the EU. It is important to note that where the provider of an electronic communications service is not established in the EU it shall designate in writing a representative in the EU. The representative shall be established in one of the Member States where the end-users of such electronic communications services are located.</p>
    <p>The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act also aim to make sure that large online platforms behave in a fair way. The regulations become one of the centrepieces of the European digital strategy. The digital services cover a wide range of daily activities including online intermediation services, such as online marketplaces, online social networking services, online search engines, operating systems or software application stores.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many of the large platforms benefit from comprehensively tracking and profiling end users. A few of them increasingly act as gateways or gatekeepers between business users and end users. The Digital Markets Act (&ldquo;DMA&rdquo;) establishes a set of narrowly defined objective criteria for qualifying a large online platform as a so-called &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo;. These criteria will be met if a company:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Has a strong economic position, significant impact on the internal market,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Operate one or more important gateways to customers,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enjoy or are expected to enjoy an entrenched and durable position in the market, meaning that it is stable over time.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>As a result, the DMA lays down harmonised rules ensuring contestable and fair markets in the digital sector across the Union where gatekeepers are present.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The proposal of the DMA is also fully coherent with the proposal for a Digital Services Act (&ldquo;DSA&rdquo;). The DSA is focusing on issues such as liability of online intermediaries for third party content, safety of users online or asymmetric due diligence obligations for different providers of information society services depending on the nature of the societal risks such services represent. The Digital Services Act is known as the act, modernising the Directive 2000/31/EC regarding illegal content, transparent advertising, and disinformation.</p>
    <p>Finally, it is of great importance to mention the latest Data Act proposal which has been published by the European Commission on February, 23<sup>rd</sup> 2022. The Act is considered to be one of the pioneers of the European data strategy and aims to ensure fair access to data and to regulate the procedures and principles regarding the use of data. The Data Act applies to both personal and non-personal data and provides a broad definition of data, covering all kinds of digital outlooks. The proposal complements the recently adopted and aforementioned Data Governance Act and Digital Markets Act. The Data Act applies to;&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Manufacturers of products and suppliers of related services placed on the market in the EU and the users of such products or services,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Data holders that make data available to data recipients in the EU,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Data recipients in the EU to whom data are made available,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Public sector bodies and EU institutions, agencies or bodies that request data holders to make data available where there is an exceptional need to that data for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and the data holders that provide those data in response to such request,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Providers of data processing services offering such services to customers in the EU.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>The Act envisages certain obligations to data owners, such as making available to the user the data generated by its use of a product or related service where data cannot be directly accessed by the user from the product and without undue delay, free of charge and if possible, continuously and in real-time. Within the scope of the Data Act, regulations regarding the protection of trade secret and intellectual property rights in data transfers are also included in the proposal.</p>
    <p>The Data Act gives public bodies a limited and exceptional right to access data held by the private sector. This right can be used where the access is necessary to prevent, respond to or recover from a public emergency such as terrorist attacks, public health emergencies, natural disasters, or where the lack of data prevents the public body from fulfilling a duty in the public interest provided by law.</p>
    <p>As the European Commission mentioned, the legislative initiatives including the Data Act will create a single market to allow data to flow freely within the EU and across sectors for the benefit of businesses, researchers, public administrations and society at large and the Data Act is deemed to be one of the main initiatives.</p>`,

    title: 'Key Actions to Drive Compliance with AI Regulations',
    text: `<p>Over the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has started to appear in many areas in business life. Recently, companies have adapted to the digital world with the use of big data and AI, in this sense, many operations are carried out by using algorithmic systems.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All these and many more other aspects lead companies to invest in AI systems growingly in order to gain a competitive advantage. The widespread use of AI requires the establishment of a compliance program - one that addresses not only keeping up with the technological developments but also with the relevant legal obligations. AI systems may cause serious risks for companies including the emergence of disputes and legal violations which highlights the importance of the existence of a compliance program. Due to the risks posed by certain AI systems, compliance programs should have a detailed, multi-layered approach and seek balance between company&apos;s expectations and legal requirements.</p>
    <p>Non-binding (softlaw) legal instruments have been widely used in the deployment of AI systems. In this regard, ethical rules, as a self-regulation mechanism, have played an important role. Although companies adopt ethical rules, policies and procedures, these texts that they have prepared themselves are not binding or inclusive. In fact, even the contents of the texts could often be incomplete. For this reason, international and regional organizations and national authorities have been working on a comprehensive and binding regulations that covers various aspects of AI systems.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this sense, the EU regulatory framework proposal prepared by the European Commission on AI could deemed to be a pioneer among legal regulations. Although there are many regulations that can affect the use of AI in various sectors and fields, the EU draft is a horizontally applicable regulation. The 2021-2025 National Artificial Intelligence Strategy published in Turkey is an important indicator that such regulations will emerge at the national level in the near future. It is considered that the said strategy will pave the way for a legal regulation in this area.</p>
    <p>Organizations should therefore establish a compliance program regarding possible requirements of AI regulations by being up-to-date with the latest developments at national and international level. The compliance programs are recommended to be prepared based on the basic obligations regulated in the aforementioned and other legal regulations while also taking the demands of organizations into account.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Key actions to consider in preparing an AI compliance program</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Build a comprehensive AI inventory</strong></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>At the beginning of compliance program, an inventory covering all the AI systems that are being used should be created. In this way, it will be ensured that AI systems can be followed collectively and risk classifications can also be made. A comprehensive and well-prepared inventory will also contribute to tracking and meeting current needs in other areas such as privacy and cybersecurity.</p>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>
            <p><strong>Keep up with the new and changing regulations</strong></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The changing and ambiguous nature of AI regulations could lead to significant changes in the requirements in a short time. In addition, the change in the risk categorization of a system may cause different obligations to be applied. Therefore, organisations will face increasingly new and complex requirements with less time to react. All these aspects show the importance of a monitoring mechanism on legislative changes which will enable organizations to meet applicable up-to-date requirements.&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>
            <p><strong>Develop a risk-management program</strong></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>A risk-based policy approach to AI applications tend to be mainly adopted. This requires implementing detailed impact assessments, developing risk-mitigation measures, preparing audits. Every organisation should be able to meet relevant requirements depending on the risk categorization of the deployed system. In order to be able to efficiently manage this process, organizations should develop and proactively monitor a risk-management programme that also includes documentation and record keeping.&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>
            <p><strong>Invest in AI compliance enablement</strong></p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Compliance with AI regulations requires a long-term effort. The most facilitating factor in this process will be the awareness of the employees. A well-prepared compliance programme alone is not sufficient to ensure effective compliance. Employees should also have awareness to adapt to this. For this reason, a checklist regarding the actions to be taken should be prepared and provided to the employees. Periodic training for the employees on AI systems, related obligations and legal regulations and ethical use of AI systems should be ensured.</p>

    title: 'Commercialization of NFT: Copyrights?',
    text: `<p>The commercialization of non-fungible token (&ldquo;NFT&rdquo;) is made through a smart contract which prevents making indiscriminate use of the token. The contract establishes all the terms regarding the use of the NFT by the purchaser. Many equate this exclusive form of ownership (of NFT) with ownership of the intellectual and artistic work (&ldquo;work&rdquo;) itself, but the distinction must be emphasized. Does the purchaser (or the minter) of an NFT own the intellectual property rights to the work associated with an NFT? The misconception goes further in case the work represented in the token has already been protected by intellectual property (IP), such as copyright.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The NFT minter or purchaser owns nothing more than a transactional record and a cryptographic hyperlink to the file, which guarentees authenticity to buyers of intellectual and artistic work through its lack of fungibility unlike other cryptographic assets such as Bitcoin, whose ownership is tracked through the blockchain technology. However, the ownership of an NFT does not entitle the owner to the ownership of the work associated with the token. Even if the regulation of NFTs is not yet a reality;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pursuant to Article 52 of the Law No.5846 on Intellectual and Artistic Works (&ldquo;FSEK&rdquo;), transfer of fiscal rights such as the right to distribute, reproduce and process an intellectual and artistic work must be made in writing, in a way that these rights are indicated separately. In this context, these rights can be specified separately in the smart contract. If it is accepted that the smart contracts meet the written form requirement stipulated in article 52 of FSEK, it seems that the transfer of the fiscal rights of the work can be made over the blockchain (NFT), provided that the transferred rights are specified one by one. Otherwise copyright remains with the creator of intellectual and artistic works. So the ownership of an NFT does not entitle the owner to the ownership of the NFTized work unless the commercialization of NFT includes the transfer of the property right of the author to the purchaser of NFT. It should be noted that in addition to it being certain that moral rights of the author pursuant to Article 49 of FSEK remains in the legal sphere of the creator.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            As part of the Digital Finance package of the European Commission, the &ldquo;<u><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593&from=EN"><em>Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation</em></a></u>&rdquo; (MiCA) which was mentioned first in the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s Fintech Action plan in March 2018, proposed definition for crypto assets including NFTs being &ldquo;<em>a digital representation of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology</em>&rdquo;. Within this perspective the bundle of copyrights, as previously mentioned, still belongs to the author, unless an external agreement is made between the author and the buyer. The Commission published the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on MiCA and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937 on 24 September 2020, and the Council adopted its position on the proposal on 24 November 2021, will have a significant impact on non-fungible digital assets, not only at a European level, given the potential of these rules being followed by companies worldwide.&nbsp;
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>As can be seen, due to the increasing importance of the aforementioned tokens, it is important to determine the rules regarding the use of such new technologies within the scope of Intellectual Property Law. For this reason, it is clear that there is a need for a special legal regulation for NFTs and their use.</p>
